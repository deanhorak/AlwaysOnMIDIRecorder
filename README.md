# MIDI Auto Recorder ðŸŽ¹

A Python utility that continuously monitors a connected MIDI input device and automatically records activity into `.mid` files.  

- Sleeps quietly while no device is present.  
- Starts recording on the first detected MIDI message.  
- Automatically stops (closes the file) after **60 seconds of inactivity**.  
- Creates new files with names like `RECYYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mid` in the `recordings/` folder.  
- Supports **manual split** and **pause/resume** via special chords on an 88-key piano:  

  - **Split chord** â†’ **A7 (105), B7 (107), C8 (108)** closes the current recording immediately and begins a new one with the next activity.  
  - **Pause chord** â†’ **A0 (21), B0 (23), C1 (24)** toggles pause/resume. While paused, no MIDI is recorded.  

Control chords are not written into the `.mid` files.
